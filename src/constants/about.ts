		"Software Engineering Undergraduate and MERN Stack Developer. I build scalable web applications and explore the intersection of full-stack development and new AI trends.",
	longBio:
		"I'm a software engineering student with a deep interest in building functional, user-centric web applications. My experience centers on the MERN stack, having moved from academic theory to real-world projects and internship roles. Beyond the code, I’ve always been fascinated by the laws of physics and the vastness of space. I enjoy applying first principles thinking often found in astrophysical theories and complex physical systems to software architecture and creative problem solving. For me, coding is just another way to explore and organize the logic of the universe. I thrive on solving complex technical challenges and building efficient, scalable solutions.",
